Commissioned by @notionhq, ""Notion"" for my Resume Tailoring Guide 🔗 I created this workspace with Notion Agents to help you edit your resume for each job application. You can find it in my IG story or bio.

Some of my most successful followers this year have been tailoring their resumes for every internship, and I built this Notion resume management tool for you to easily do the same and keep track of your resumes.

Turn on story notifications to get updates on resumes that successfully landed 2026 internships—including resumes from non-target school students and international students.

Share this with your friends and family so they don't get left behind. And leave your feedback in the comments!

3,How useful is tailoring your resume for companies like Meta (where you submit your resume for the job posting but also have a resume on your profile that they tell you to keep updated) Is it better to update the main profile resume with each new tailored resume or just keep your main profile resume the same?,309
