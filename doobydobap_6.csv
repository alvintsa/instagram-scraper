gdofmnstrs_free_palestine,"I'm still trying to perfect fried dakbal. I tried it while in Busan, and I know swear it is the best part of a chicken, though I wasn't as impressed with the dakbal soup I found in NYC. I believe the place in Busan actually fried it twice, which is what I think might be throwing mine off. It still tastes good, but it's not nearly as good as it should be. Anyway, I always appreciate you sharing your love of food, and your love of eating as much of the animal as is edible.",0

minicns,"We have similar dish in Serbia, called Pihtije, it’s just that we would cut the meat in tiny pieces and add it to the water (liquid) it was cooked in, with lots of garlic. After it chills, you can slice it into pieces and serve as appetizer 🥰🤤",0
