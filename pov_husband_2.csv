raerootsyoga,I don’t get why the size of this fish is necessary if he’s only feeding his wife. I hope others are present to consume the food and it isn’t going to waste. Concerning because sashimi once filleted and room temperature won’t last long. I really hope this isn’t wasted. Bigger isn’t better this account would be more appealing if he was serving a normal proportion of food. Greed and waste are not sexy.,0
