oryxstoyotacamry,"Ok, I’m sure we all know this, but this is not possible to do unless he’s using bots. If we take this at face value and say it is 10.5mil applications, across 365 days, 24 hrs per day, 60 min per hour and 60 sec per min that comes out to 1 job application every 3 seconds. If we then account for time to sleep, let’s be generous and say 6 hrs a night on average, and then 30 min per day to eat, that comes to 1 application every 2 seconds. I get that this is an Ad (which you are required to disclose legally 47 U.S code 317 applied to all internet uploads) but this is absurd.",0

yahia_not_found,"Math aint mathing 10,520,439 in 365 days is a bit wth unless u automate it : suppose you had 6 hours of sleep per day (since ur jobless i'd assume more but ur eyes are telling me that its doable) let's also assume that except that only 2 hours of your life are taken by other activities like eating , basic needs , touching some grass (iykwim) u'd end up with 16 hours daily 16×365(days)×60(minutes/hour)×60(seconds/min)= 21 mil seconds so 1 out of 2 seconds if your existence you are applying , without taking into consideration cover letters, connection latency, typing speed etc...
