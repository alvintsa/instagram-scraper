caxrlos,"applied for a sales job and found their work number, cold called the HR manager and she was absolutely shook. Did not get the job 🤣",0
_beyond_human_,So what do I sent them them? Funny gifs? Violett Threats? Im a bit puzzled rn,0
oli.j.l,What do I email them?,0
formersailorjimmy,"I find it better to look them up in the White Pages, find their home address, and wait outside their door with a resume on hand. They really can't say no because they know you know where they live ...",0
jojo_19o7,I thought this was standard practice. Almost everyone i work with does the same 😂,0
ari_kutzer,"""I do this one thing to help me land jobs even when the market is bad"" um how often are you having to ""land"" a new job...? 😂",0
theoracleiam,"I do this for jobs I really want, never not gotten the job",0
kimlu666,"We been doing that, job market is trash",0
zanzanzanzan,"This is a good tip. It’s a lot of work to do for every app, but do it for ones you care about. What also helps is scouring LinkedIn and socials for similarities you can bring up in first round. I’ve never not gotten to second round doing this.",0
isabellamorales.studio,"Everyone is burnt out tired and poor so we have to do 10 steps more when applying for jobs that don’t full fill ourselves, yeeey",0
named.eli,tried this. They don’t respond to you dude. Or they do and then ghost you,0
milandominic_,"Used to work, but now it often goes to spam or gets overlooked since it’s really common. Follow ups still matter just make them thoughtful.",0
darksoulsdragan,Then gets ignored,0
chuuzus,imagine being a full blown stalker to just land a job and you still think the job market isn’t terrible?!,0
sky.islands,this is the 2025 version of going to the job site to hand them your resume,0
thaipaul,sure. but that doesnt automatically mean they'll answer. I did that and probably 0.25% of the time. they'll answer. Still never got a job out of any of those.  Most people still prefer hiring within their own network.,0
loganmartin_ig,"Most jobs have no reply, you can get the hiring manager wrong, early career emails are usually overflowed and don't respond. I guess miss all the shots you don't take, but that's not being lazy by not doing it. It's being normal and generally realistic. You're going out of your way, which is great, but nuance, realism, and not calling people lazy would be great.",0
grace.jc_seo,It’s that lucky duck isn’t it?,0
gringa_fala_portugues,Email is better But most company block external emails( your 📧 will be considered as phishing),0
carlos_menchaca,"Thanks!!! I’m in creative services, and this is the exactly what I needed to cut through all the LinkedIn clutter with my portfolio",0
sj_approved,I would say use an internal contact at the company to forward your resume directly to the hiring manager. People don't like being stalked by strangers.,0
alesslee12,"Bad advice, you'll be stalking people",0
linseigh,"As someone who has served on hiring panels across multiple industries, this is actually annoying as hell. Usually we are extremely busy and overwhelmed w recruitment & some of y’all really do start spamming us before we have even gotten to your initial application or finished discussing it internally. This has never made a good impression, esp as those who do this tend to come off as very pushy and impatient. Like we remember you NOW, but for the wrong reasons",0
annalogy22,"It's not true that people don't do this. It's super common practice, and 90% of the jobs I've applied to lately have said do not try to contact us, you'll hear from us 💀",0
sandramoayala,"So I did it and received a message back on LinkedIn from the hiring manager saying that the recruitment process is ongoing and that I will be contacted if my application is successful. She seemed upset about reaching out to her, so I tried and I don't think it's going to help my application at all.",0
mayabue,"As an Executive Assistant to C-Suite and Founders, emails to Directors and other Execs might never get read. The hiring managers are on the look out. Emailing them might be a better strategy and make sure that you make your email stand out with something particular about your work that differentiates you.",0
fabian_fierros,"There's nothing no one is doing . People are everywhere. And if you thought about a unique idea, no you didn't someone already thought of it and did it.",0
imade.noubir,This definitely isnt for everybody as its a desperate move which will cause them to lowball u with salary,0
o.swny06,@juanadeu hey dude,0
yakubianprototype,as of youll do that then they block you for annoying them like the 50th person doing it to them,0
pdwohl,Those people get hundreds of emails a day.,0
joshuahawksworth,"This needs so many things to be effective. 95% of job listings are from recruitment agencies that obscure the company’s name. Even if you find the company, you then have to hope they have the hiring manager/relevant contacts in their people list and THEN you have to hope their email is publicly searchable? That pretty much thins the list of companies down to giant companies that have internal recruiters (like google)",0
kangrooice,Well the email finding site is the ad here stfp,0
rsfzhzbdms,this is just mildly agressive stalking method that might work but if you want a guaranteed one just find their home address and hold their kids hostage till they confirm they aint gonna call the cops on you an sign a minimum 5 year legal comtract that you're gonna be working for them no matter what. Crazy shi we've got to do now 😂🤦‍♂️,0
tahhanworks,"To have to do this to land a job sucks, we should make our own small companies and help each other work the jobs we want, I'm 100% sure with everyone in the comments can make a company with all its requirements.",0
alaa_ajefemi,I honestly h8 when people immediately send an email after applying. Wait 3 days at least.,0
catharina.broes,"I've had this advice multiple times, so I've been doing it for a while. I never get a message back on LinkedIn, even from normal employees (non-directors or hiring managers)",0
michelle_no_o_o,Where did you get that duck?,0
peace_oglory,"Unless I was trying to hire a stalker or detective, I would be 💯 weirded out by this behavior. But then again, I don’t know how hiring managers think.",0
a1._.dil,Does it depend on the type of job one has ?,0
saraisaraisaraisar,Man... I can't believe i have to do this for dollar store or goodwill. Cuz no one is hiring!!!!,0
ph4rhan,What if I don't have much experience in the field?,0
hrudaisannidhi,Do you think this would work for internships? I am a junior in college and am looking for one rn,0
christine.branson,"After interviewing for my job I wrote down the names of everyone on the interview panel, searched on the organization website, and sent them all a thank you email. I got the job.",0
technocraft.llc,Had a hiring manager visibly annoyed that i contacted him. Did not get the job,0
nizio_mom,"Literally do REGULAR MAIL. Look up the address, use AI to find who that business, job, whatever boss/director/CEO WHATEVER. The jobs I got years ago that were the best were ones I flooded management with hand written very nice and detailed notes asking them to take a chance on me as obviously I’m very persistent and through!",0
d_r_the_curator,This does not guarantee you get the job 🙄,0
_.edemirci,but what do you email/message them? giving them a heads up that you applied or,0
kaisersezhello,Thanks for actually saying what you did quickly 👏,0
alex_paillart,"Doing that. But most of time, they’re ghosting you",0
bleucarta,"Doesn’t work when you get to jobright, just tried it a few minutes ago.",0
_someone_you_dont._know,"Can you give a email template as well. What to send in the email to these managers, recruiters and directors?",0
gringogidget,"As the person on a hiring panel sometimes, I’d find this weird. Unless it was a “thank you for taking the time to meet with me…” post interview.",0
amanda._.luo,Doing god’s work🙏🏻,0
nasirally,"Ngl, this is how I got my job. I followed up after applying",0
this.is.the.last.time,they read emails? 🤣 100 unread messages is for beginners. When your inbox says 999+ its bliss,0
pandorapiink,That’s how I got my job. It was damn impossible before then.,0
that_girl_van_,"Where do you think it's best to apply for jobs? Directly on the company's site, LinkedIn, or indeed?",0
brandeeno28,Unless you know someone you’re cooked,0
hayeonnnnnnnn,methods been patched for a looooong time,0
corbi.lol,You are also amongst the thousands of people doing this,0
ketc.h,yeh idk what year you're in but calling directly will most likely get your resume placed at that bottom (outside of maybe retail),0
jagadish_2000_,How do I find their emails??,0
krossty123,Don't do this. it just makes you super annoying. Just spend more time in your portfolio or sending application,0
naomis_dress,I think I’ll just blow my head shmoove off in front of them instead,0
5843_dan,"""beg them for a job"" we shouldn't have too",0
madebymartincho,"I messaged the HM, manager and or director. Hundreds on hundreds. And I mean hundreds. The response rate was shit. The whole thing stinks",0
whitty_works,The problem I run into with this strategy is that 99% of the jobs I apply for have a strict ‘no canvassing’ policy; which means doing these steps will get me disqualified. 😕,0
