erikasever24,"Noooooo Ladies, your skin deserves more than petroleum byproducts 🛢️. Petroleum jelly was invented in the 1800s from crude oil waste — it’s not a miracle moisturizer, it’s a sealant. It doesn’t hydrate, it just sits on top of your skin and traps everything underneath, good or bad. For some women, that means clogged pores, irritation, or long-term imbalance. Instead of slathering your face in something refined from oil, try plant-based alternatives like jojoba, squalane, or shea butter. They actually feed and repair your skin while giving you that same protective barrier. Don’t settle for the cheap fix when your glow is worth the good stuff",0
