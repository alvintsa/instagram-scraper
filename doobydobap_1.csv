tictacsgirl,"I'm Spanish and moved to the UK because I needed space from my family and that has been the best decision. We're still in contact and we still see each other, but distance has helped me a lot. There's still a lot of awkward conversations to be had, but hopefully we'll get there",5

nickdaez,"family dynamics are so complex. haven't talked to my mom in 6 months and it was a conscious choice. needed the time and space away from her so i could focus on my life and heal from trauma. at the same time, i told myself she needed the same time and space so she could sit with herself and hopefully, heal from unprocessed stuff she hasn't dealt with since she was young. complicated stuff but still trusting that when the time is right, we can both meet halfway and build a better, healthier relationship.🙏",126

roxhayne,Doobydobap life advice vids in 2025 is like those rare animal sightings thank you for this. 🤌,2025
omersalt,This only worked because you re only child and your family is filthy rich. I made similar things in my 20s and we re not seeing each others at least 8 years now.,5
dblank80,"Let me see if I’m close, in a nutshell you moved away to Spain I believe. Your parents were upset by this and concerned. A fight ensued you saying you know what you’re doing and the parents disagreeing. You didn’t really talk for some time because both sides were being stubborn. Then one side caved in, everyone spoke and you went back home and now everyone is on the same page.",60
