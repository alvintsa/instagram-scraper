yamacita_rose05,"Tbh, 9-5 so that way you have at least money to save up for your favorite hobby and then make your hobby into a career.",17
largeteo,"9-5 easily, cause then I can enjoy my hobby and relax knowing I can not have to rely on it for money. Having a stable job is very good for your mental health honestly. Dont underestimate post secondary either despite all the criticism it recieves,it is a gateway to a lot of opportunities. I thought trying to start a business and “hustling” was the only way and I ended up just being stressed and broke, developing a serious eating disorder and sinking into depression. I wasted 4 years of my life chasing the “big break”. I realized only now after years that schooling and finding a slightly more mundane job that pays the bills is more valuable for me at least. Thank you Tina, for bringing an excellent point up. Hustling isnt the only way to succeed!",40

77dead,"I'll say this, I wanted to make it as a photographer, and as soon as I got it as a career I got it young. I was 20, I hated shooting for work and it wasn't as fun as when it was my hobby. I also felt like I didn't have friends because I was in constant motion and most people only wanted to be my friend to shoot. As apposed to when I have a 9-5 my coworkers are my friends, and I can tell they're genuine because I have nothing to offer, other then myself.",20

manseyaa,"the way you’re thinking right now is the right way. You shouldn’t just listen and follow what these ppl say, you analyze and choose whats best FOR YOU. always think about the third option that nobody gives you💛💛",2
_yoyoco,"Hell yeah this so good. I used to be on that “gotta be grinding 24/7” mindset and it really got me no where. Now I understand what makes me in happy in life. I work to make money for bills, to party with my friends, and buy things I like. I have a hobby I love to work on to fufill my mind and this way I’m much happier than I’d ever be if I “made it”.",24

uhhleenah,"It’s all about perception and that’s what Gary V preaches. Do what makes you happy and if you can make money from it great, if you’re happy with your 9-5 he says that’s great too. Why call him out? Lol",0
