yamacita_rose05,"Tbh, 9-5 so that way you have at least money to save up for your favorite hobby and then make your hobby into a career.",0
largeteo,"9-5 easily, cause then I can enjoy my hobby and relax knowing I can not have to rely on it for money. Having a stable job is very good for your mental health honestly. Dont underestimate post secondary either despite all the criticism it recieves,it is a gateway to a lot of opportunities. I thought trying to start a business and “hustling” was the only way and I ended up just being stressed and broke, developing a serious eating disorder and sinking into depression. I wasted 4 years of my life chasing the “big break”. I realized only now after years that schooling and finding a slightly more mundane job that pays the bills is more valuable for me at least. Thank you Tina, for bringing an excellent point up. Hustling isnt the only way to succeed!",0

hyeinhaley,But also you can have a job you love and have more work life balance for yourself and then have a hobby! Those things aren’t exclusive to one another 😊,0
hyeinhaley,"I would 100% do what I love 24/7 than have a hobby outside of work. Working a job you don’t love really sucks girl - work doesn’t always stay at work even if you don’t love it. I wouldn’t look on the other side! Obviously I don’t know your side but as a person working hard to eventually only have a job I love, you have to work full-time to earn a living, then you come home to study… Then squeeze your time for fun.",0

I also felt like I didn't have friends because I was in constant motion and most people only wanted to be my friend to shoot. As apposed to when I have a 9-5 my coworkers are my friends, and I can tell they're genuine because I have nothing to offer, other then myself.",0

_dylanhodges,"While it’s nice of you to try and tell young people to take care of themselves and not burn out from working.. it’s also destructive because I think I can safely say that 75% of people under 30 do not make enough money even from a non-entry level job, to purchase a home. And those who rent, are forced to pay a large portion of their income to something that isn’t an asset. Yes of course we shouldn’t be burning ourselves out and we should be enjoying our lives, but our lives will not be enjoyable in the future if you don’t work 2 jobs to be able to save for a ridiculous down payment on a home just to be able to own a home and safely retire.  It is now almost necessary for people who don’t own a home to work 2 jobs.",0

bigotakugamershawny,"See the thing that people don't understand about GaryVee is that his advice isn't speaking to everyone, and he even says that. There's MULTIPLE times and videos where people tell him or he ask, ""Are you happy? Yes? Then you already won. You don't need my advice"" His advice is for the people that say they dont want a 9 to 5, the people that have ideas and dreams and wants it to be there job, the people that have no idea what they want and looking for answers, and the people that feel like they don't have time or support to do more. THATS who his advice is for. If you have a 9 to 5, have hobbies, and you are happy, he ALWAYS says you won and don't need to listen to his motivation",0

noisethingz,"I think it also really depends on what kind of 9-5 you are doing. I totally agree with what you are saying but honestly, if you want to work 9-5 choose a place you feel comfortable with. A place with no to barely any toxic people and one that you resonate with in what your company is and does, not everything but most of them. Otherwise it will just drain you. It's the same with working for a passion 24/7. It truly depends on what it is and if you have reflected on yourself in these matters. Working 9-5 can be fun, but as someone who does work 8 hours but with shifts going beyond 5 o'clock. You have Barely any social life, time for yourself and the things that need to be done. Esp if you aren't someone who is a 'hustler' in a way of what you see online, waking up at 5 am and going so much already and even after work still doing a lot. Most people who work like that with these shifts look like life has kind of left their eyes. At least, that's what I was able to see in my perspective.",0

bartbenton,I believe that mental freedom from your job once you punch out of work cannot be understated. Until you are substantially secure running your own business your work is scattered throughout every day most of the time. Decisions decisions. I think the answer is to do what you are good at for work and have your passion/ hobby be what brings you pure bliss and never make it more than that unless an unavoidable opportunity comes along.,0

randomrushgirl,"i love this perspective. i have a 9-5 (well not really, my hours are flexible) job and several hobbies i’m passionate about. it’s the most standard desk job with lots of research work but i love it. i’ve had people ask me why i don’t make one of my hobbies a full time job because i’m good at it and if i were serious, it would pay me well. that’s a great compliment but along with the actual work i do, i love the stability and culture of learning that comes with my job. i can definitely see myself converting to pursue my hobbies but honestly, i feel i’d start hating it because of the cons of the pursuing it. if i’d try that, i know i’ll miss coding and debugging programs while cracking programming jokes with my colleagues. so let’s see. it’s never too late to start anything 🥰",0

thesoulsomelivingblog,"Simple have another hobby outside your work ( hobby turned work) something you enjoy, learn a new skill … life generally is like that fulfilment is like a mirage and we always want to get that feeling I guess 🙌❤️ but this kind of video is rare to find. Thanks for putting it out",0
timenabi,A lot of people associate “following their passion” with “dream job+$$$” Following your passion for some is a giant leap of faith because their passion might not be as lucrative as a 9-5.. on a financial standing it’ll make sense for most to do a 9-5 and keep their passion as a hobby and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.. It’s only my opinion but my thoughts are that if you change your perspectives on things that you’ve labeled as “mundane” and “grey” then the whole school of thought of a 9-5 being mundane can be reversed and find some closure that this life isn’t such a bad life.. some people end up living a miserable life because all they do is struggle “trying” to make it with the wrong mentality. You’re considered lucky if you have a passion that can also support you financially. Especially if it’s growing.. following a passion can be like raising a plant.. for some it’ll grow and thrive and other’s will die.. not everyone is ready to take risks but that shouldn’t mean that a 9-5 in comparison should be boring and mundane.. for those individuals who do see it as such.. try to manage your work life and personal life.. even if it’s cloudy the sky can still be beautiful. It’s all about having the right mentality for me…,0
