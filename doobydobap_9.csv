vedant.3011,"I’m excited to share that I’ll be attending the iconic Lalbaugcha Raja Visarjan once again this year—a tradition that holds a special place in my heart. Last year’s experience was unforgettable, and this time, I want to take it to the next level. My Instagram account is growing rapidly and is about to hit more Then 300 k views currently So if Upload Full vlog of 33 Hours because I will straight shoot for 33 hours same I did last year I just had phone so able to took limited amount of glimpses , and I believe it’s the perfect platform to showcase something that has never been done before: capturing the world’s biggest Ganpati Visarjan in an immersive 360-degree experience using an Insta360 camera. No one has ever documented Lalbaugcha Raja Visarjan like this, and with Insta360’s cutting-edge technology, I can bring the magic, emotion, and energy of this divine celebration to life like never before. I’d love the support of Insta360 to make this vision a reality—together, we can create something truly unforgettable for millions of devotees around the world.",300
